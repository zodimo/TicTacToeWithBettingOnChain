# Serialization

to and from inline datums :)

- abstract factory for a script address.
- a script is unique and should treated as such.
- a data or redeemer is single data type
  - 0 or more data constructors
- plutus data = json schema
- parse plutus data to object of "normal" types to be parsed as input to object factory
